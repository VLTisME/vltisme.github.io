__I don’t consider myself a successful person, and I won’t guarantee that these methods will be helpful for you. Best to see this blog as a reference. Hopefully, one or two of these tips will help with your learning journey. Good luck!__

## First, here are my current learning strategies:  

### Rule #1: Physical health + mental health MUST be all good.  
This means:  
- Sleep enough.  
- Have a strong body, no injuries or illnesses.  
- No stress. Keep your mind at ease and free from anything weighing on your heart.

### Okay, let’s start:  

**Golden rule:** BEFORE DOING ANYTHING, YOU MUST THOROUGHLY CHECK THE DIRECTION YOU'RE ABOUT TO GO IN!  
(This doesn’t just apply to studying—it works for life too.)  

1. **First and foremost:** Know what you need to study -> You can even ask ChatGPT to create a roadmap for you.  
2. **Learn the abstract first!**  
   Ask yourself:  
   - What does "it" include?  
   - What does "it" do?  
   Just get a general idea of what you’re learning and its uses. For example: "This topic has A, B, and C. What do A, B, and C actually do?"  
3. **Deep dive!**  
   Go deeper into each part you learned in Step 2:  
   - How does "A" work?  
   - How does it achieve that?  
   Keep asking the "how" of everything.  
4. **Yeah, that’s it! :D**  
   You’ll find that your studying becomes much easier, faster, and more fun.

### Final note:  

Okay, that’s all for today. I’ll update later :o.
