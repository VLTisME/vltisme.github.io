## About Me  

- *Hi, I'm Tuan! A freshman at VNU-HCM University of Science who loves exploring creative solutions, learning about tech, and sharing knowledge with the community.*  
- *Welcome to my world. I’m passionate about AI, Competitive Programming, Human Development, and Astronomy. This is where I document my journey.*  

### Little Things About Me:  
- I love writing, especially about human development and emotions.  
- Always striving to be better than yesterday.  
- Sometimes I look for a quiet place to think; other times, I just want to be with someone. Is this a sign of being single for too long?  
- I deeply cherish life—never harm even a single ant.  
- I have the mindset of a swordsman, or maybe a monk.  
- I enjoy challenges (I once rode 90km on my cheap bike and ran half-marathon, lol).  
- I love stargazing! Sadly, the night sky in Ho Chi Minh City is extremely light-polluted :(. My favorite spot for this hobby is on the beach in my hometown.  
- I love traveling:  
  - To the towering mountains of China.  
  - To spiritual places like India.  
  - To breathtaking landscapes like Norway, and more.  
- I want to try extreme sports like skydiving, parachuting, climbing, and more.  
- I love teaching and helping others (this brings me so much joy). If I had more time, I’d teach more of what I know or do more charity work.  
- I love singing, though I sing terribly!  
- **Instruments**: I can play *Do Re Mi Fa Sol* on the guitar, kalimba, and flute.  
- I read a lot of manga '-', mostly these genres: Adventure (*One Piece,...*), supernatural (*One Punch Man,...*), big-brain (*Liar Game, Death Note,...*), human development (*Vagabond,...*), romcom (*Kaguya-Sama,...*), and some really dark ones (*Berserk,...*).  
- In the past:  
  - I loved STEM activities like crafting with paper cartons, batteries, ice cream sticks, and making car models.  
  - I drew flipbooks, did origami, and experimented with creative stuff.  
- I’m always ready to help someone, lol, but I can be a bit annoying at times.  
- I wish health and happiness to everyone, and I hope we all become a little better every day.  
- **Languages**: Vietnamese, English, and some French (if I had more time, I’d learn it seriously).

**Bonus**: I'm still single '-'.
