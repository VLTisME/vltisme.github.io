## Must-do when using Git/ Github
First, imagine starting a new world, nothing is there! We will start our adventure for now!

### Create a repository on Github
Then... all of a sudden, a massive tank appeared!

### cd
Welp firstly, there must be somewhere so that I can put my code there... So let's find it!

### Create a repository on your device
OMG, another tank appeared!

### mkdir, ls, touch, echo, vi, cat
- mkdir: create a new folder.
  e.g: mkdir Lel $$\rightarrow$$ create a folder named Lel
- ls: list all stuff inside a folder.
- touch: create a new file.
  e.g: touch "haha.txt" $$\rightarrow$$ create a file called lel.txt
- echo: create (if doesn't exist) and append content in there.
  e.g: echo "this is the content" > "haha.txt" $$\rightarrow$ if "haha.txt" doesn't exist, create one and append "this the the content" in the content of the file.
- vi: allows you to write contents for a specific file
  e.g: vi "haha.txt" $$\rightarrow$ then it will show you the current content of "haha.txt" and do what ever you want there. If you want to exist, press "Esc" then type ":wq" or ":x".
- cat: allows you to view the content of a file.
