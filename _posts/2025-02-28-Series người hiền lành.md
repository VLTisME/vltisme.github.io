## Reflections
Up until now, he had always lived in a small world, never truly looking beyond it. Because of this, deep within his heart arose a certain arrogance, a sense of conceit (like a frog at the bottom of a well). Fortunately, albeit just a little, he became aware of this starting from his 12th grade year. Only now has he told me that he feels he's finally seen it more clearly. Back then, he always sought to show off, always looking for ways to let the world know just how "awesome" he was. All of his actions and thoughts may have seemed correct on the surface, but they were ultimately driven by one thing: ego.

Let me break it down – he didn’t actually want to study back then. However, because his friends were studying, he was forced to study too, otherwise, he would fall behind and lose to others → a sense of competitiveness, a fear of losing.

## These days

## The encounter
- Today, he met a person he would never think that would appear there.
