## Manus

Manus is a revolutionary AI tool that has completely transformed my workflow. It's an AI-powered assistant that understands context, generates comprehensive content, and helps tackle complex projects with remarkable efficiency.

### How Manus Revolutionized My Workflow

What used to take me a full week can now be completed in just an hour with Manus. This isn't an exaggeration - during the recent GDGoC Hackathon, I needed to create extensive documentation for our CV solution for small-scale farmers. Normally, this would have required days of research, organizing information, and writing detailed explanations. With Manus, I described the project requirements, and it generated the entire framework of the documentation in minutes. I only needed to make minor adjustments to match our specific implementation details.

### Real-World Time Savings

Here are some concrete examples of how Manus has saved me time:

- **Documentation Creation**: What used to take 3-4 hours of organizing and writing now takes 15 minutes
- **Project Planning**: A comprehensive project plan that would have taken 2 days to develop was completed in 2 hours
- **Research Synthesis**: Consolidating research findings that would have me working for hours are often organized in minutes with Manus's intelligent assistance

### Why Manus Stands Out

Unlike other AI tools, Manus:

1. **Understands Project Context**: It can analyze your requirements and existing content to make suggestions that align with your goals
2. **Generates Production-Ready Content**: The output isn't just functional—it's well-structured, comprehensive, and follows best practices
3. **Learns Your Style**: The more you use it, the better it adapts to your preferences and patterns

### The GDGoC Hackathon Experience

For our hackathon project focused on computer vision solutions for small-scale farmers, Manus was instrumental in our success. It helped us:

- Create comprehensive documentation that clearly explained our technical approach
- Develop a structured presentation of our solution that was easy for judges to understand
- Generate explanations of complex CV concepts in accessible language for non-technical stakeholders

The entire documentation that would have taken our team days to create was largely generated by Manus, allowing us to focus more time on refining our actual solution.

### Getting Started with Manus

If you're considering trying Manus, I recommend starting with smaller tasks to get comfortable with how it works. The learning curve is surprisingly gentle, and within a day, you'll likely find yourself tackling increasingly complex problems with its help.

The productivity gains are real, and the quality of work hasn't suffered—if anything, it's improved as Manus helps me consider aspects I might have missed on my own.


## Cursor
I found this [tutorial](https://github.com/dereknguyen269/cursor-best-practices) very helpful for setting up Cursor!

Here's my recommended setup process:

1. Create new project
2. Configure key settings:
   - Enable Auto-run mode with unlimited protection
   - Allow large context
   - Enable Web Search
   - Add Claude Sonnet 3.7 Deep Think
   - Allow Early Access updates
   
3. Add essential services:
   - MCP Documentation Services
   - Basic rules configuration
   - System prompt for Agent identification
   
4. Set up project files:
   - Create .cursorignore
   - Create .cursorrules
   - Initialize git repository

> ⚠️ **Important**: This configuration allows Cursor to execute code with your system permissions. Make sure you understand the security implications.

**Trick for fast setup**: You can't directly tell Cursor to adapt these setting above because Cursor isn't allowed to modify the setting, so instead, tell it to create a json file for cursor setting and tell it to edit the setting inside that file :D

Fun fact: Part of this post was created by Cursor, and the whole Git & Github post was created by Cursor :).
